IT-Forensics needs specific data or artifact from the victims computer to investigate about Cyber Emergencies and estimate on the total amount of damage caused. Currently there are different data acquisition systems on the market, but all of them share decisive disadvantages. These workstations are quite expensive, unable to carry out remote data and  designed for the use of a forensic scientist. The purpose of this paper is to design an easy-to-use and cheap data acquisition system which requires a least amount of user interaction to gather all information which could be useful for the forensic team and transfer it via the network or stores it offline, on external devices. The system itself decides weather to send full images or just send specific artifacts to the forensic servers based on the bandwidth and stability of the current network.
