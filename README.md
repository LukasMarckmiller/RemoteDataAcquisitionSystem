IT-Forensics needs specific data or artifacts from the victims computer to investigate the cyber emergency and estimate on the total amount of damage caused. Currently there are different data acquisition systems on the market, but all of them share decisive disadvantages. These workstations are quite expensive, mostly unable or limited when it comes to carry out remote data and designed for the use by a forensic scientist. \\The purpose of this thesis is to design an easy-to-use, flexible and cheap data acquisition system which requires a least amount of user interaction to gather all information which could be useful for the forensic team. The system itself decides weather to send full images or just specific artifacts to the forensic servers based on the bandwidth and stability of the current network. If there's no connection to the forensic servers, data could also be stored on the device itself or on conected hard drives.
